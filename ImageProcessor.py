# This file can be compared with Objective-C's main.m in which the 
# UIApplicationMain() function sets up an infinite runloop.
#
# Here, the MotionDetector class sets up an infinite runloop when 
# startDetecting() is called. In contrast to Objective-C's UIApplicationMain(),
# this mainLoop can be cancelled.
